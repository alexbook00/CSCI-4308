Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of March 15th - 21st. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
Make progress on reports and the web interface.

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe and went over updates we had on our progress, as well as asked questions we had come up with over the course of the week. He sent us some more branding info for the web interface.

What we plan to accomplish in the next week:
We won't be meeting with Joe this week but will continue to progress on both reports and the web interface.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
