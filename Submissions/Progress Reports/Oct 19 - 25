Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of October 19th - 25th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
Seek feedback and/or approval on the project charter, as well as discuss our preliminary ideas for the solution.  

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe to talk about project details. During that meeting, it came about that the Project Charter wasn't sent along as we thought it was, so we did that. We talked about some broad pieces of the Charter, and the Caliber team will review it and get back to us with any feedback. We also discussed the test data and how it could/would be used, as well as our desire for a direct database connection if at all possible (likely view-only access).

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week:
We will seek feedback and approval on the project charter, as well as discuss project requirements. We will also hopefully gain more insight into the possibility of easier data access (direct connection or possibly copies of entire database tables for our reference).

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
