Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of March 8th - 14th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We aimed to dig more into the reports we want to make.

What we accomplished this week:
We split up the necessary workload, placing two of us (Blake and Dylan) in charge of the web interface on which the reports/dashboards will be displayed. The other four of us are in charge of the reports themselves. We talked over some ideas with Joe and received more clarification about various parts of the data (and will hopefully be able to have a couple new useful data fields included).

What we plan to accomplish in the next week:
Reports. Also hopefully make progress on the web interface, but our main focus now is around these reports.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
