Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of April 5th - April 11th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We aimed to implement the changes that were suggested in the meeting with Joe and Darin and move toward a more uniform look for our reports.

What we accomplished this week:
We are working on implementing the changes/ideas suggested, and will likely make sure we have all content absolutely nailed down before moving into a uniform aesthetic.

What we plan to accomplish in the next week:
Finish up our report contents and bring uniformity into the picture.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
