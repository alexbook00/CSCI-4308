Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of April 12th - April 18th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We aimed to begin finishing up our reports and making sure they have a uniform look.

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe, Darin, and Todd to discuss our work so far and get any suggestions they have, and worked toward implementing those changes.

What we plan to accomplish in the next week:
Put finishing touches on the reports content-wise, then give them a uniform look/style.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
