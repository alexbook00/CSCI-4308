Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of February 15th - 21st. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We really wanted to continue moving forward with learning the API, as well as getting a database set up should it be needed for any testing.

What we accomplished this week:
We got API calls up and running, and continue to learn more about its functionality in relation to what we are aiming to achieve. We also have a database set up should it be needed.

What we plan to accomplish in the next week:
We want to get some sort of basic report creation working with the API, as well as familiarize ourselves further with creating useful, detailed reports using the PowerBI interface.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
