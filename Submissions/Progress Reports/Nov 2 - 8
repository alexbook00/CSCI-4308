Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of November 2nd - 8th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We planned to hash out the project requirements and formalize them into a clear document.

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe and had a fairly lengthy discussion regarding the project requirements. We decided we would create a mockup of the UI using Figma, which would help us determine the precise workflows that are to be used to accomplish all desired available utilities from the solution. We met as our student team and worked on the Figma mockup. However, in the process of creating it, had a great discussion regarding the requirements as a whole, and how we would likely go about implementing them. This spurred a realization among all of us that a Figma wasn't particularly necessary, as we had a somewhat clear vision of what we believe is desired.

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week:
We will explain our thoughts to Joe, and ask if our vision of what is desired in the solution meets what he and the Caliber Team are looking for, and finish a comprehensive requirements document.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
