Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of January 25th - 31st. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We wanted to make sure we had a solid grasp on the data we have been given and wished to start experimenting a bit with PowerBI and its API (specifically embedding possibilities).

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe and largely discussed our understanding of the data, as well as plans going forward. We mentioned some issues we had with viewing the data, so Joe sent us Excel files in order to remedy any problems we were having.

What we plan to accomplish in the next week:
We will have a good grasp on the necessity (or lack thereof) of permissions in order to view embedded PowerBI reports, and will soon after start getting into how we will implement the API in our overall design.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
