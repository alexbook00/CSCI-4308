Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of October 26th - November 1st. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We will seek feedback and approval on the project charter, as well as discuss project requirements. We will also hopefully gain more insight into the possibility of easier data access (direct connection or possibly copies of entire database tables for our reference).

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe and he said the project charter looked good. We discussed a bit about some ideas with Flask for the solution. We also circled back to database access, and Joe said he can get us access to part of their database without doing a training course or signing an NDA.

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week:
We will hash out the project requirements and formalize them into a clear document.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
