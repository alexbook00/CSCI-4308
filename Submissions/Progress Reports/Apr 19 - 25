Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of April 19th - April 25th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We aimed to finish polishing up our reports and make sure they have a uniform look.

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe to go over our proposed uniform style and made any changes necessary.

What we plan to accomplish in the next week:
We will double-check to make sure all necessary changes have been made to reports and the web interface, then complete all documentation before handing our work over to Caliber.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
