Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of November 9th - 15th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We aimed to explain our thoughts to Joe, and ask if our vision of what is desired in the solution meets what he and the Caliber Team are looking for, and finish a comprehensive requirements document.

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe and discussed at length our ideas for getting a solution that performed as desired. We talked about the possibility of embedding PowerBI into a webpage and allowing users to communicate with it (pass it commands) through its API. We also put together a requirements document.

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week:
We will show Joe the completed requirements document and seek feedback. We will also look more into the PowerBI API more to determine its feasibility.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
