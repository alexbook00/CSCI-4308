Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of March 1st - 7th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We aimed to send a list of possible reports to Joe for approval and brainstorm further ideas. We also wanted to look into the possibility of running simply data-cleaning Python scripts through PowerBI, should such a utility be necessary.

What we accomplished this week:
We sent our list of ideas to Joe for approval and received it, along with other places to look for ideas. We discussed some of these ideas with Joe in our meeting and brainstormed some other useful reports that could be made similar to those we saw in the links sent to us by the Caliber team.

What we plan to accomplish in the next week:
We're going to dig into the reports and find the best general layout for what we want to show (we want to format each report fairly similarly in order to reduce stress on the user, so it's important that we test out a variety of different layouts/formats).

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
