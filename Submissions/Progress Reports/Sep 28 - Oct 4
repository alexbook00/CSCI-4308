Hello all,

This email serves as the first of many weekly progress reports. As this is the first, we're not entirely sure what everyone feels is appropriate to include here, so please let us know what else is desired!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
Get an intro/demo of the previous/current reporting tools the Caliber team use for their solutions (UI, workflow, etc.).

What we accomplished this week:
Met with the Caliber team and got a demo of the current tool and how it works, as well as discussed some possible options for tools to work with during this project.

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week:
Meet with the Caliber team to flesh out what exactly is expected of us in regards to deliverables, application specifications, and software development methodologies, as well as collaboratively complete the project charter. Possibly explore more technical tools to use during this project.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
