Hello all,

Happy new year! This email is the status report for the week of January 18th - 24th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We planned to have a beginning-of-semester meeting with Joe as a sort of "welcome back" meeting, as well as to go over the work to be done in order to get off to a great start this semester.

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe and largely discussed the data that can be accessed using our PowerBI credentials, as well as some general discussion regarding updates from lingering questions/concerns from before winter break. Before next week, we will look into this data more to gain an understanding of what we can possibly accomplish/display with it.

What we plan to accomplish in the next week:
We want to make sure we have a solid grasp on the data we have been given and wish to start experimenting a bit with PowerBI and its API (specifically embedding possibilities).

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
