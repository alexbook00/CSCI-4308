Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of October 12th - 18th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
Finish off the project charter and send it to them for approval. Also start discussing "starter" ideas for various areas of the solution (languages, possible frameworks for the UI, etc.).

What we accomplished this week:
We met as a team to finish the project charter and sent it along to the Caliber team for approval. During that meeting, we also started discussions regarding what tools we are considering for the solution. Those decisions are still very much preliminary, yet useful in getting ideas bouncing around. We also individually looked at the test data we received in order to get a grasp on the data we'll be handling with our solution.

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week:
We will seek feedback and/or approval on the project charter, as well as discuss our preliminary ideas for the solution.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
