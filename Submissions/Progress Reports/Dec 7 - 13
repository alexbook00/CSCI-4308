Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of December 7th - 13th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We planned to have an end-of-semester meeting with Joe to go over what should be done over the break, as well as make sure any loose ends were tied up.

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe to go over our plans for the winter break, as well as to make sure he and us on the student team were all on the same page. We also went over a summary of what had been accomplished over the course of the first semester (September - December).  

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming weeks (over winter break):
Our main goals over break are to explore PowerBI (specifically its API), as well as take our time going through all of the information sent to us by the Caliber team.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
