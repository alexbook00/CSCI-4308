Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of November 30th - December 6th. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
Our goal by the beginning of classes in mid-January is to learn more about PowerBI and its API, and to look through the volume of emails we've received from the Caliber team. Both this past week and this upcoming week are quite definitively crunch time for our final exams and final projects so unfortunately, our time has been and will be devoted to other coursework in the short term.

What we accomplished this week:
Joe and our team decided to cancel this past week's meeting due to needing to catch up on various work since Thanksgiving week. Our team polished off the rest of the course deliverables in preparation for the end of the semester.

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week (and in this case, the following weeks as well):
As highlighted both above and in the previous progress report, our main goal at this point of the year is simply to learn more about PowerBI (specifically its API), as well as sort through all of the helpful content sent to us by the Caliber team.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
