Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of October 5th - 11th. Again, feel free to let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
Meet with the Caliber team to flesh out what exactly is expected of us in regards to deliverables, application specifications, and software development methodologies, as well as collaboratively complete the project charter. Possibly explore more technical tools to use during this project.  

What we accomplished this week:
Met with the Caliber team and figured out what is expected of us in all of the aforementioned areas. We also received test data that will help us make various design decisions in the planning of our solution.

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week:
We aren't meeting with the Caliber team this week, so we will finish off the project charter and send it to them for approval. We will also start discussing "starter" ideas for various areas of the solution (languages, possible frameworks for the UI, etc.).

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
