Hello all,

This email is the status report for the week of November 16th - 22nd. As always, let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

What we planned to accomplish in the past week:
We aimed to show Joe the completed requirements document and seek feedback. We also wanted to look more into the PowerBI API more to determine its feasibility.

What we accomplished this week:
We met with Joe and the Caliber team and discussed our idea of essentially creating a wrapper around PowerBI, and the idea was generally well-liked. We also talked about various details surrounding the usage of PowerBI. Additionally, we received affirmative feedback on our requirements document. Lastly, we created the mid-year team video mandated by the course staff. It is attached to this email.

What we plan to accomplish in the upcoming week (and in this case, the following week as well):
The main goal at this point of the year is simply to learn more about PowerBI (specifically its API). We've received various emails from the Caliber team containing useful information, so we will look through that when possible. As finals are approaching and our typical semester-length courses approach "crunch time", we may not be able to spend as much time as we would like on this project in the upcoming few weeks, but we still aim to further our understanding of PowerBI and our plan to use it.

Best,
Alex Book & Student Capstone Team
